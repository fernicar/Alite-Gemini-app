1. the project is a reimplementation of the old codebase:
`read-only-backup/TINS_project_files/source_java.txt`
2. there is a duplicated file structure of several java files renamed as *.txt for individual access in:
`read-only-backup/src`
3. all the implementation in typescript had been following the old codebase when possible. old codebase is the sole inspiration, and it was made in java but now has to continue as typescript.
4. the space battle gameplay mechanic will remain 2d, elements can be in 3d but the movement is limited to the plane.
5. the folder `assets/` has the content that belongs to the game and could be reused. note: it has been moved from `read-only-backup/assets/` to simply `assets/` for easy use.
6. Do not change values in the name of "balancing", the idea is to implement what the game is, not to create a different game.
